# Laravel View Error Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
**"View [layouts.partials.user-menu] not found"** - The owner dashboard layout was trying to include a non-existent partial view.

## Root Cause
The `resources/views/layouts/owner-dashboard.blade.php` file contained two references to a missing partial:
```php
@include('layouts.partials.user-menu')
```

This partial file `resources/views/layouts/partials/user-menu.blade.php` did not exist in the project.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Fixed Layout File** (`resources/views/layouts/owner-dashboard.blade.php`)

**Removed problematic includes and replaced with inline user menu:**

**Mobile Sidebar (Lines ~58-76):**
```php
<!-- Before (causing error) -->
@include('layouts.partials.user-menu')

<!-- After (working inline code) -->
<div class="flex items-center">
    <div class="flex-shrink-0">
        <div class="h-8 w-8 rounded-full bg-green-100 flex items-center justify-center">
            <span class="text-sm font-medium text-green-800">{{ substr(auth()->user()->nama, 0, 1) }}</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ml-3">
        <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">{{ auth()->user()->nama }}</p>
        <form method="POST" action="{{ route('logout') }}" class="inline">
            @csrf
            <button type="submit" class="text-xs text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700">Logout</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Desktop Sidebar (Lines ~85-103):**
- Same inline replacement for the desktop version

### ✅ **Features Preserved**

1. **User Avatar**: Shows user's first name initial in a green circle
2. **User Name**: Displays the logged-in user's name
3. **Logout Button**: Functional logout form with proper CSRF protection
4. **Responsive Design**: Identical user menu for both mobile and desktop
5. **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing design system

### ✅ **Cache Cleared**
```bash
php artisan view:clear
```
- Removed compiled view cache containing references to the missing partial

### ✅ **Verification Steps**

1. **No More Missing References**: Confirmed no other files reference `layouts.partials.user-menu`
2. **Existing Partials**: Only `owner-sidebar-nav.blade.php` exists (which is properly used)
3. **Server Running**: Laravel server starts successfully without view errors
4. **Layout Functional**: Owner dashboard layout works with intact navigation and user menu

## Testing Results

- ✅ **View Error Resolved**: No more "View [layouts.partials.user-menu] not found"
- ✅ **Server Running**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` operational
- ✅ **Layout Intact**: Sidebar navigation and user menu working properly
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved

## Code Quality

- **DRY Principle**: While the user menu code is now duplicated for mobile/desktop, this is acceptable for a small component
- **Maintainability**: Simple inline code is easier to maintain than missing partial references
- **Performance**: No impact on performance, actually slightly faster without include overhead
- **Security**: CSRF token properly included in logout form

The owner dashboard layout now works without any missing view errors while maintaining all original functionality!
